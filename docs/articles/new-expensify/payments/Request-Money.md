# How do these Payment Features work?
Our money movement features enable you to request money and even split bills with a group.

**Request Money** lets you request to be paid back directly in Expensify. Whether you’re asking a friend to pay you back for a concert ticket or your boss to reimburse you for a conference, when you send a payment request, Expensify will display the amount owed and the option to pay the corresponding request right in a chat between you.

**Split Bill** allows you to split payments between multiple people and ensures the person who settled the tab gets paid back.

## Can I request money from more than one person at a time?

If you need to request money for more than one person at a time, you’ll want to use the Split Bill feature. The Request Money option is for one-to-one payments between two people.

## Can I change an expense once I’ve submitted it?

Yes! You, your approvers, and your admin can change some of the details on an expense (except amount and date).

## Can a tag be edited?

Yes, a tag can be edited by approvers, admins, and members until the expense has been paid.

## How are tags created?

Tags are imported from a connected accounting package or manually created by a workspace admin.

## What are expense reports in Expensify?

In Expensify, expenses are submitted on an expense report. The expense report will always show the Next Steps on the report. The **Next Steps** will detail the next stage for the report (ex., “These expenses are scheduled to submit later today. No action required”). 

**Pro Tip:** The green or red dot on the left-hand side of the app will notify you of any expense reports requiring your action. Keep an eye out for those notifications!

When a draft report is open, all new expenses are added to the draft report. Once the report is submitted, expenses can no longer be added to the processing report. 

## What are the different types of expenses? 

**Reimbursable expenses:** Expenses paid with personal money, either cash or credit card, that the company will pay back to the purchaser or person submitting the expense.

**Non-reimbursable expenses:** Expenses paid with company money, typically a business credit card.  These are expenses that the company only needs to track.

**Billable expenses:** expenses that need to be re-billed to a specific client or vendor.  These expenses can also be reimbursable or non-reimbursable. 

## What are the different expense details?

Here’s a list of the details you can include on an expense. Some of these are required, and others are optional. We recommend contacting your admin if you have questions about what details must be added to an expense. Members, admins, and approvers can add or change these details on an expense. 


- Amount (required)
- Description
- Merchant (required)
- Date (required)
- Category 
- Tags
- Billable
